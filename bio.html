            <h1>Trey Sullivent</h1>
            <div class="bio-text">
                <p>Hello, I'm Trey Sullivent, a software developer with a growing background in automation and process improvement. My professional path has been defined by a commitment to enhancing the efficiency of various systems through intelligent automation solutions. With a solid background in RPA tools like UiPath and Microsoft Power Automate, along with a robust command of programming languages, I specialize in turning complex workflows into streamlined processes.</p>
        
                <p>In the realm of DevOps, I focus on promoting and designing CI/CD(continuous integration and delivery) principles to improve the software lifecycle. My work involves leveraging cloud technologies such as Azure to manage scalable solutions effectively. I’m always exploring ways to better harness these technologies to deliver value and agility to my team.</p>
    
                <p>My formal education in computer science and mathematics has been a cornerstone in developing a logical, analytical approach to problem-solving. It gave me a huge variety of opportunities to apply my skills to all kinds of different problems, from robotics to UI design. It's also where I honed my leadership skills, balancing multiple roles that ranged from academic responsibilities to organizational leadership.</p>
    
                <p>When I'm not coding or automating, I find myself working on personal tech projects that satisfy my urge to experiment and learn. Beyond the screen, I'm an avid Dungeon Master in the world of D&D, a disc golf amateur, and a connoisseur of the kind of movies that are so bad, they're good. These hobbies reflect my love for strategy, casual sportsmanship, and a good laugh, rounding out my life outside of work.</p>
    
                <p>I’m keen on connecting with like-minded professionals and organizations to explore new technologies and take on challenging projects. Let’s chat about the future of automation, or swap stories from your most recent dungeon!</p>
